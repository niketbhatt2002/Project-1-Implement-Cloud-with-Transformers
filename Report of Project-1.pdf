1. Task Definition:
Objective: Develop a text summarization model to condense news articles into concise summaries.

Significance: Summarization tools can save time and improve accessibility to information.

2. Dataset Insights:
Dataset: CNN/DailyMail.

Preparation: Removed duplicates, normalized text, and filtered irrelevant entries.

3. Training Summary:
Model: Fine-tuned T5-small on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

Training Parameters: 3 epochs, learning rate of 2e-5, batch size of 8.

4. Evaluation Results:
ROUGE Scores:

ROUGE-1: 0.45

ROUGE-2: 0.25

ROUGE-L: 0.40

Analysis: The model performs well but could improve with more training data or a larger model like T5-large.

5. Future Improvements:
Larger Model: Use T5-large or BART for better performance.

More Data: Train on the full CNN/DailyMail dataset.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates and batch sizes.
